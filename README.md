## Documentation

assembler-mixins's documentation is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)-based site and
is publicly hosted on GitHub Pages.  You may also run the docs locally.

### Running documentation locally

[Github](https://github.com/) has a [great guide](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)
for setting up Jekyll for use with Github pages.  I've outlined the basics below.

1. [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/), if you don't already have it. Should be version `1.9.3` or better.
2. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io/) via `gem install bundler`.
3. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v2.5.x). Run `bundle install` from the root directory.
4. Change into the `/assembler-mixins` directory and run `grunt dev` in the command line.
5. Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000> in your browser.

:exclamation: **Note Windows users:** Read [this unofficial guide](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.
